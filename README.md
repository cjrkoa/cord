# Eccia: A Mental Health and Emotional Support Chatbot

581 million people worldwide struggle with an anxiety or depressive disorder. Of those, 72.4% with an anxiety disorder and 39% with depression won't recieve treatment. Several systemic barriers prevent greater accessibility to mental health treatment including lack of investment, staff, awareness that mental health disorders are treatable conditions, and social stigma. 
Poor treatment access correlates with increased social isolation, identity and confidence struggles, and work-related problems. Eccia is a GenAI-based mental health and emotional support chatbot designed to compassionately address these widespread systemic issues and make treatment accessible to anyone with a mobile device.

I built this project over the course of nearly two years to help people struggling with anxiety and intended to launch as this app as a venture â€” I chose to retire Eccia due to signals that the market was moving away from standalone chatbot solutions.
